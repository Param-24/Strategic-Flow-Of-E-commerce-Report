    <h2 style="color: rgb(255, 59, 173); font-size: 38;">Q. What are E-commerce Strategies?</h2>
    <p style="color: rgb(255, 225, 109); font-size: 25;"><img src = "ecom1.png" height="255" align = "left" hspace = "15" vspace = "5"/>Ecommerce strategies are interconnected plans that drive your business operations.<br><br>There are three major ecommerce strategies to consider:<b><br>Product Strategy, Customer Relationships, and Corporate Considerations.</b><br><br>Each of these must work together to ensure the best possible outcomes for your brand.</p>
    <br><ul>
        <br><h2 class="subs"><li>Product Strategy</li></h2>
        <p class="para">Product strategy comprises inventory management and development. It includes processes like - <br>
        <center><img src="product_strategy.jpg" height = 220/></center><br>
        <ul class="points">
            <li><b>Development research -</b> Who is in charge of the research portion of your products? Will it be primarily accomplished in-house or by a third-party organization?</li>
            <li><b>Product orientation -</b> What kind of people want to buy your products, and how are they perceived in the marketplace? You may want to rely on a two-by-two matrix or a SWOT analysis to navigate the planning process better.</li>
            <li><b>Inventory supply chain - </b>How do you plan on getting products, and how viable will this approach be in the future? Is there enough flexibility in the structure to account for shortages?</li>
            <li><b>Line of products - </b>Consider the entire width and breadth of your product line. How much do you want to offer? Are you planning on multiple varieties with customization options (i.e., t-shirts with different logos) or just multiple lines of related products (t-shirts, shorts, etc.)?</li>
            <li><b>Product viability - </b>Are your products evergreen, meaning they remain relevant all year long? Or are they going to be seasonal? Perhaps you’ll want a mix of both to increase sales during different events or holiday seasons.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <br><h2 class="subs"><li>Customer Relationships</li></h2>
        <p class="para">Building a strategy for managing customers is imperative for tracking the lifecycle of the buyer’s journey. There are many important things to consider along the way, including:
            <ul class="points">
                <li><b>Target market -</b> Who is the audience your brand is trying to reach? You may want to create user personas detailing your customers’ specifics, including their demographics, ages, income, and psychographics.</li>
                <img src="customer_relationship.jpg" height = 250 align = "right" hspace = "15" vspace = "5"/>
                <li><b>Company branding -</b> How do you want to present yourself to customers? Think through all elements of this, including your company logo, brand voice, and business name.</li>
                <li><b>Sales channels -</b> How do you plan on accomplishing the customer acquisition process? Social media? Emails? Webinars?</li>
                <li><b>CX and UX -</b> Consider the impact of your customer experience and user experience. Do you have everything in place to wow your buyers, including great customer service and an accessible website?</li>
                <li><b>Customer retention -</b> Is there a specific frequency at which customers should order from your company? How will this impact your sales and profit margins in the future?</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        <br><h2 class="subs"><li>Corporate Considerations</li></h2>
        <p class="para">While you may not feel your ecommerce company is large enough to worry about corporate relations, the fact is that every brand needs a detailed process for communicating with business entities. This strategy should consider:
            <ul class="points">
                <li><b>Shareholders -</b> If your brand decides to go public, how will you manage your shareholder relations? <img src="Stakeholder-management-min.jpg" height = 255 align = "right" hspace = "15" vspace = "15"/> How many investors do you want, and how will you communicate with them? Additionally, do you have a way to repay stakeholders over time?</li>
                <li><b>Financing -</b> How much capital does your business need to get started—and how much will it need to grow over time? Will you have an established credit line with a bank, or will you tap into alternative sources like Shopify Capital?</li>
                <li><b>HR -</b> If you have at least one employee at your business, you’ll also need a solid HR strategy. How will employees get their benefits, and what benefits should they include? Can they ask for PTO, and what will be the procedure for this? Will you require documented processes for hiring, firing, and promotions?</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
    </ul>
